## Compound Interest Calculator
```
f = p × ((r/100)+1) ^ n

f = Future Amount(£)
p = Principal Amount(£)
r = Interest Rate(%)
n = Number of Periods
t = Type of Period (days-weeks-months-years)
```
## An example

Compound interest is one of the most powerful forces of investing. ... Simple interest simply means a set percentage of the principal every year, and is rarely used in practice. On the other hand, compound interest is applied to both loans and deposit accounts.
```
If the £1000 loan was for a period of 6 months at 10%:
1771.56 = 1000 × (0.1+1) ^ 6 months
£1,000 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 = £1771.56

f = £1771.56
p = £1000
r = 10% (10/100 for decimal)
n = 6
t = months
```
